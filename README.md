# Address Autocomplete form for Android

This code sample demonstrates how to create an address form with autocomplete for Android apps. We use the [Geoapify Address Autocomplete](https://www.geoapify.com/address-autocomplete/) to get address suggestions and Latitude/Longitude coordinates.

The code sample uses only a few API parameters. You can improve your app's user experience by filtering results by country or adding a customer's location to search nearby. Check the [API documentation](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/geocoding/address-autocomplete/) for more information about the parameters.

## Run the code sample
We use Android Studio and Java programming language for this code sample. Below are instructions for installing the Android Studio and running the code sample from scratch. If you have Android Studio installed, you can skip the installation steps.

1. Go to the [Android Studio website](https://developer.android.com/studio), download the latest version and install Android Studio.
2. Download this project and open it in Android Studio.
3. **Important!** To get an API key, go to the [Geoapify page](https://www.geoapify.com/) and sign up. Detailed instructions are available [here](https://www.geoapify.com/get-started-with-maps-api/).
4. **Important!** Open *"java/com/autocomplete/view/API/APIClient.java"* class and replace *"YOUR_API_KEY"* with your API key.
5. Create and start a new device in Android Studio.
6. Run "app" on the virtual device.
